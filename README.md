Contains MOSIP test rig and the functional tests

We encourage you to read the [Tester Documentation](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-docs/wiki/Tester-Documentation) to gain some insights regarding test strategy, design and automation.  

Information regarding component-level test automation suite can be accessed from [Test Rig Design](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-docs/wiki/Test-Rig-Design).

The source code from this repo can be built and a series of sanity tests can be executed against the deployed MOSIP Platform.  The steps are present in https://github.com/mosip/mosip-functional-tests/blob/master/automationtests/README.md
